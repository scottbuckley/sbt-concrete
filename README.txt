sbt-concrete provides a plugin for the Scala simple-build-tool that allows
concrete object syntax to be used in Scala code. Specifically, Scala code
can contain blocks of object creation and pattern matching code written 
in a custom syntax. The plugin parses those code blocks and translates them
into normal Scala code.
